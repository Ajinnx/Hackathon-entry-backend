Simple login and register code using PHP and MySQL.
This proyect database was created with Xammp, so insert the login_register folder inside the htdocs folder
usual path -> "C:\xampp\htdocs"

Use the DB inside the backup folder to import in your phpMyAdmin or create a DB with what ever fields you want,
remember to modify the code as needed in that case.
