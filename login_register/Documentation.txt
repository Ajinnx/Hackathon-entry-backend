------DOCUMENTATION------

This proyect was made using php and mysql since is what i'm more familiar with, the organization of the proyect is as this:

-separate the .php files in two folders, private(wich is inaccessible via url) and public(the main program)
-in the private folder i created the .htaccess to make it inaccessible, then separated the functions:
	-> database.php is the connection with the db and functions.php to create functions as needed.
	-> the autoload.php works as a loader of .php files required so we can access more .php in case we create more, without the need of writing 1 by 1.
-the public folder contains the login, index, sign up and logout:
	login.php:
	-> the login works as this, the use of seasson is used to save a crsf token for security porpuses and to save the current user seasson to close later in the log out.
	-> using the prepared statement to execute database queries with paramenters, since add more protecction and optimization.
	-> if everything is correct and gets data from the db then use fetch and store data in seasson the redirect to index.php, if something's wrong, show error message.
	-> after that is the html with bootstrap for a simple and modern page.
	signup.php:
	-> similar to the login.php but i use preg_match to validate the use of special characters with the username and the email just in case.
	-> same use of prepared statements and in the end i add a pop up message for when a user has successfully registered.
	logout.php:
	-> saves the seassons.
	index.php:
	-> checks the current seasson, by default there's none so it should redirect to the login.php page, if there's seasson data then shows a welcome message and the option of 	log out.
